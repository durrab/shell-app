# A sentinel policy file controls the behavior of security components and how they interact with your build.
# The contents of the file are subject to audit and should be used to circumvent any security controls.
# The file should be named .sentinelpolicy (notice the leading period) and be placed in the root of your repository

# codescanaccess - these entries will add people to be able to view your report in CodeGate UI.  It is typically used
#                  to add a project manager, manager, or director who has not committed code but needs to review results.
#                  This is a comma seperated list and you can more than one of them in the file.  The input is <userid>.

# forcefullscan - Checkmarx by default does incremental scans unless 7% or more of the code changes.  This improves speed.
#                 if you would like a full scan every time (which may improve accuracy or make two scans produce exactly
#                 the same output you can set this value to true.  It is false by default.

#
# codescanpolicy - This determines which preset checkmarx uses for scanning. By default this is OWASP TOP 10 - 2017. 
#                  you may be requested to use the PCI preset if your application handles payment card data.  The valid 
#                  settings are:
#                  All, OWASP TOP 10 - 2017*, PCI, SANS top 25, Android, HIPAA, Mobile, WordPress, Apple Secure Coding Guide

# safeline - this is used by the secrets scanner to suppress lines it detected as secrets.  If this is a true secret
#            THIS SHOULD NOT be used to disable secrets detection.  See https://appsec.walmart.com/secrets for 
#            proper methods on storing secrets for your application.  Multiple entries are supported within the file.
#            The format is filename;line;comment.  All fields are required.
#
safeline=default.js;31;accessToken is the name of a cookie and does not contain secret info
safeline=default.js;33;refreshToken is the name of a cookie and does not contain secret info
#
#
# safefile - This is used by the secrets scanner to supress entire files that it detects.  This is mostly triggered by 
#            filenames which may trigger the detection.  If your file contains secrets THIS SHOULD NOT be used to disable 
#            secrets detection.  See https://appsec.walmart.com/secrets for proper methods on storing secrets for your 
#            application.  Multiple entries are supported within the file.  The format is filename;comment.  All fields
